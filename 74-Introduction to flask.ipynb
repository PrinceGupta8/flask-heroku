    "Flask is a lightweight and flexible web framework written in Python. It is designed to help developers build web applications quickly and with minimal setup. Flask is often described as a \"microframework\" because it does not come with pre-built tools or libraries for every use case, allowing developers to choose and integrate only what they need. This makes Flask an excellent choice for small to medium-sized projects, prototypes, or applications that require high customization.\n",

    "### Key Features of Flask:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Lightweight and Modular**:\n",
    "   - Flask is minimalistic, providing only essential tools.\n",
    "   - You can expand its capabilities by adding extensions as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Built-in Development Server**:\n",
    "   - Flask comes with a built-in server for debugging and testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Routing**:\n",
    "   - The `@app.route` decorator makes it easy to define URL routes.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Templating**:\n",
    "   - Flask uses **Jinja2** for templating, allowing dynamic HTML generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Flexibility**:\n",
    "   - Developers have full control over components, making it easy to integrate custom solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Extensions**:\n",
    "   - Flask can be extended with libraries like Flask-SQLAlchemy for databases, Flask-WTF for forms, and Flask-Migrate for database migrations.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Core Components:\n",
    "- **Werkzeug**: A WSGI utility library for request and response handling.\n",
    "- **Jinja2**: A modern templating engine to render HTML pages dynamically.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Flask Code Example:\n",
    "Hereâ€™s a simple Flask application:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from flask import Flask, render_template, request\n",
    "\n",
    "app = Flask(__name__)\n",
    "\n",
    "@app.route('/')\n",
    "def home():\n",
    "    return \"Welcome to Flask!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "@app.route('/hello/<name>')\n",
    "def hello(name):\n",
    "    return f\"Hello, {name}!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "@app.route('/submit', methods=['GET', 'POST'])\n",
    "def submit():\n",
    "    if request.method == 'POST':\n",
    "        name = request.form['name']\n",
    "        return f\"Hello, {name}!\"\n",
    "    return '''\n",
    "        <form method=\"post\">\n",
    "            Name: <input type=\"text\" name=\"name\">\n",
    "            <input type=\"submit\">\n",
    "        </form>\n",
    "    '''\n",
    "\n",
    "if __name__ == '__main__':\n",
    "    app.run(debug=True)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Use Cases:\n",
    "- **APIs**: Flask is ideal for building RESTful APIs.\n",
    "- **Web Applications**: Suitable for dynamic websites and dashboards.\n",
    "- **Microservices**: Flask's lightweight nature makes it perfect for microservice architectures.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Advantages:\n",
    "- Easy to learn and use.\n",
    "- Highly customizable.\n",
    "- Large and active community.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Disadvantages:\n",
    "- Not suitable for very large projects requiring built-in tools.\n",
    "- Requires manual integration of some components.\n",
